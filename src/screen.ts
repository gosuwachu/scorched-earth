/**
 * Screen protocol for the mouse-driven out-of-game UI -- a faithful TypeScript
 * port of scorch-py/scorch/screen.py (the fidelity oracle).
 *
 * main.ts drives a STACK of screens.  Each screen:
 *   - handle(event) -> null, or an action string the driver acts on
 *         ('pop', 'push:sound', 'start_game', 'shop_done', ...).
 *         The convention for opening a submenu screen is 'push:<name>'.
 *         A panel screen returns 'pop' on Done/Esc/click-outside.
 *   - update(dt)    -> advance any animation/timers (no-op for static panels).
 *   - draw(surf)    -> render onto the logical surface, dimming/overlaying the
 *         background as appropriate (a modal panel dims behind itself).
 *
 * The action string is a thin contract; the driver (main.ts) owns stack
 * push/pop and any data hand-off.  Screens never call back into main directly.
 *
 * NUMERIC NOTE: this is a pure base/interface -- the three methods are no-ops
 * returning null and `opaque` is a flag.  There is no math, no state mutation,
 * and no pixel output in the base class itself (subclasses in screens.ts /
 * main.ts / ingame.ts do the drawing).  The differential gate
 * (test/screen.test.ts) therefore asserts only the base contract: the three
 * methods return null and `opaque` defaults to true, byte-for-byte with the
 * Python base class.

 *
 * Python expresses `opaque` as a class attribute (`opaque = True`) that
 * instances inherit and subclasses override (`opaque = False`); the driver
 * reads it as `getattr(screen, "opaque", True)` (main.py:74,400,696).  The
