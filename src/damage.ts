/**
 * Detonation -> damage -> shield -> health, plus fall damage. A faithful
 * TypeScript port of scorch-py/scorch/damage.py (the fidelity oracle, itself
 * byte-verified against 1.5/SCORCH.EXE). Catalog 11 sections 1/3/5.
 *
 * Damage law (catalog 11 s.1) is LINEAR: damage% = (R - d)*100/R, zero beyond R,
 * rounded to int.  Byte-verified: all three explosion engines use the same
 * multiplier 100.0 -- standard FUN_4d1e_015a:107 (DAT_5f38_683c=100.0f), nuke
 * FUN_3770_041d:83 (DAT_5f38_5692=100.0f), dirt FUN_35d5_0009:97
 * (DAT_5f38_52aa=100.0f).  The catalog tagged the main-engine multiplier BLOCKED;
 * direct byte reads (file_off 0x55d80+offset) promote it to FACT.
 *
 * Two distinct damage paths in the engine:
 *   FUN_4912_04b2 (apply_tank_damage): hit-counters -> shield gate FUN_4191_0034
 *     -> overflow to health FUN_3a16_0fe8.  Used by every radial/charge/laser hit.
 *   FUN_3a16_0fe8 (apply_health_direct): subtract from health, NO shield, NO
 *     hit-counter.  Used by the direct-hit instakill (FUN_4d1e_0021:24) and by
 *     tank-fall damage (FUN_2975_048c:222 and the faller half of the squash) --
 *     so a shield does NOT absorb fall damage or a direct hit.
 *
 * Shield gate (FUN_4191_0034, s.3): D<S absorbed (S-=D), D>=S destroys shield and
 * overflows D-S to health.  Fall damage = 2*pixels (s.5.2, DAT_5f38_5164=2);
 * parachute deploys iff threshold < predicted damage and negates it.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * NUMERIC NOTES (load-bearing for the differential gate, test/damage.test.ts):
 *
 *  - Python `int(x)` truncates TOWARD ZERO  -> Math.trunc(x).
 *
 *  - Python `round(x)` is BANKER'S ROUNDING (round-half-to-even), NOT JS
 *    Math.round (which rounds .5 toward +Infinity).  The radial damage law
 *    round((R - d)*100/R) lands on exact half-integers for many (R, d) pairs
 *    (e.g. R=8,d=3 -> 62.5; Python round=62, Math.round would give 63).  So this
 *    module implements pyRound() = round-half-to-even and uses it where the
 *    Python uses round().  Getting this wrong flips the dealt damage by 1 on
 *    every half-integer falloff sample.
 *
 *  - Python `math.hypot(dx, dy)` -> Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy), NOT Math.hypot.
 *    V8's Math.hypot and CPython's math.hypot disagree by 1 ULP on irrational
 *    results (the multi-arg scaling path differs; MEASURED: 92/441 integer-grid
 *    inputs differ).  But the engine only ever measures blast distance between
 *    INTEGER pixel coordinates (_tank_center returns the tank's stored integer
 *    (x, y); explode() is called with integer impact pixels), so dx,dy are
 *    integers, dx*dx+dy*dy is an exact integer, and a single correctly-rounded
 *    Math.sqrt reproduces CPython's math.hypot BIT-FOR-BIT (MEASURED: 0/441
 *    integer-grid mismatches).  Using Math.sqrt of the exact squared sum is both
 *    faithful to the oracle's value and free of the libm hypot divergence.
