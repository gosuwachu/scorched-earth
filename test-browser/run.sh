#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Browser render-crash harness: one-command runner.
#
#   1. start the vite DEV server (per-file /src/*.ts modules -- REQUIRED so V8
#      coverage maps to individual modules; `vite preview` serves a minified bundle
#      with no per-module URLs AND would not include this harness page).
#   2. run the playwright driver against it (drives every real render state,
#      collects coverage).
# The server is started in THIS shell (background + PID + trap) so it outlives the
# command, and is killed by PID at the end.  NEVER `pkill -f vite` -- that
# self-matches this script's own command line and would SIGTERM the runner.
#
# Usage:  bash test-browser/run.sh
# Exit:   0 = every render state painted with no exception; non-zero = a crash, a
#         blank canvas, a pageerror, or the server failed to come up.
