# Scorched Earth - HTML5 / TypeScript Port

A browser reimplementation of **Scorched Earth v1.5** (1995, DOS) by **Wendell Hicken** -
"The Mother of All Games" - running natively on TypeScript + Canvas2D + Web Audio.
No plugins, no WASM, no Python or DOS runtime: open it and play.

### Play it now: https://digitalcybersoft.github.io/scorchedearth-html5/

Nothing to install - it is a static HTML5 page that runs in the browser.

It reproduces the original's turn-based tank artillery - destructible terrain, the
weapon shop, the computer players, the physics and wind, the economy and scoring -
reconstructed function-for-function and verified against the original's behavior.

Scorched Earth, subtitled "The Mother of All Games," was created by **Wendell Hicken**
and distributed as shareware for DOS. The original is Copyright (c) 1991-1995 Wendell
Hicken. All rights to Scorched Earth - its name, design, artwork, sound, terrain data,
and original code - belong to him. His site is `whicken.com`.

This project is an independent, **non-commercial tribute**. It is **not affiliated
with, endorsed by, or supported by Wendell Hicken**. The game design is entirely his;
this port only re-expresses its mechanics in TypeScript so the game can run in a
browser today. If you want the genuine article, seek out Wendell Hicken's original.

## How it was built, and how faithful it is

This is not a fresh interpretation - it is a *verified reimplementation*:

1. The original DOS binary was reverse-engineered **statically** (it is never executed)
   into a function-for-function **Python/pygame port**
   ([scorchedearth-python](https://github.com/DigitalCyberSoft/scorchedearth-python)),
   itself differential-tested against the recovered machine code.
2. This HTML5 build is a TypeScript rewrite of that Python port, with the Python port
   as the **oracle**: every module is proven to reproduce its Python counterpart.

The verification:

- **15,705 differential tests** (`npm test`, vitest) assert the TypeScript reproduces
  the Python port's output **exactly** (integers, pixels, bytes) or within a tight
  epsilon (transcendental math only). The RNG reproduces CPython's Mersenne Twister
  bit-for-bit; the game engine is checked by 29,814 turn/round state snapshots; the
  sprites by ~8M pixel assertions.
- A **visual regression gate** (`visual/`, `bash visual/run_gate.sh`) renders identical
  seeded game states through both the TypeScript Canvas renderer and the Python pygame
  renderer and pixel-diffs them. The game **world** - sky, terrain, tanks - comes out
  **byte-identical** (zero channel delta). Only on-screen text differs, because a
  browser's font rasterizer is not pygame's; that is expected and reported separately.

The original binary is never run by anything in this repository.

## Play

Open **https://digitalcybersoft.github.io/scorchedearth-html5/** in any modern browser.
There is nothing to install - it is a static HTML5 page (Canvas2D + Web Audio +
JavaScript). A short loading bar fetches the assets, then the menu appears.

Controls: Left/Right aim the turret, Up/Down adjust power, Tab cycles weapons,
Space or Enter fires, number keys select a tank, F11 toggles fullscreen, Esc backs
out. The menus, the weapon shop, and the in-game control panel (battery, parachute,
shield) are mouse-driven.

### Play together on a LAN

On the host computer, install Node.js 20 or later, then run:

```bash
npm ci
npm run lan
```

Open one of the printed host URLs, select **Start Game → Online**, and share the
lobby's QR code or join link. Everyone must be on a network that can reach the host
computer's port (3000 by default). If several network addresses are listed, choose
the address on the same LAN as the players; the lobby also accepts a manual address.
Set `PORT` before starting the server to use another port.

Players choose a name and tank on their phones or browsers and press **Ready**.
The host can add computer tanks, choose their difficulty, and start with 2–10 tanks
once all human players are connected and ready. The host can play using the same
join link on a separate controller page. **Local** retains the existing game setup.

Watch the battlefield on the host screen. Each controller shows its tank's status,
aiming and firing buttons, inventory, equipment, and purchasing controls. Online
matches use sequential turns: only the active player can act. Purchasing also takes
turns; each player presses **Done**, and the host advances the shared round results
with **Continue to purchasing**. The existing round and match-ending rules apply.

Reopen the original join link in the **same browser, with its storage intact**, to
resume your tank, including during a round or shopping. Refreshing a controller is
safe. A second tab for the same player replaces the first. Disconnected players
keep their tank and their turn waits for them; new players cannot join after Start.

Keep the host game page **open and visible**. It runs the game; the Node server
relays controls and serves the pages. A temporary network interruption reconnects
automatically, but refreshing/closing the host page or restarting the server does
not recover the match. Rooms without a host expire after five minutes. Keeping a
stable host address and port also keeps controller browser storage on the same origin.

For development, `npm run dev:lan` runs the LAN server with Vite on the same port.
`npm run start:lan` serves an existing build. `npm run test:online` runs the standalone
protocol tests; `npm run test:online:browser` runs the multiplayer browser checks
(install Chromium with `npx playwright install chromium`, or set `CHROMIUM_PATH`).
After building, `npm run test:online:production` checks the shipped pages and server.
The static hosted site supports Local play; Online requires this LAN service.

## Building from source (developers only)

The game is written in TypeScript and compiled **once** to the browser JavaScript that
ships above; players never run any of this. It is only for modifying the code.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build        # static bundle into dist/ (what GitHub Pages serves)
npm test             # the 15,705 differential tests against the Python oracle
```

## The original assets

This repository **includes** Wendell Hicken's original v1.5 data files under
`public/assets/` - the 10 `.MTN` digitized mountains, `TALK1.CFG` / `TALK2.CFG` tank
taunts, and `SCORCH.ICO` - so the game plays with the genuine landscapes and taunts out
of the box. **These files are Wendell Hicken's property**, included only to keep this
tribute faithful and immediately playable; they are not the authors' to license. The
engine also runs without them (procedural terrain, gradient title, no taunts).

## How the code is organized

| Module | Reverses |
|--------|----------|
| `rng.ts` | CPython Mersenne Twister, bit-exact (the determinism linchpin) |
| `constants.ts` | byte-verified physics / damage / scoring / color-band constants |
| `terrain.ts` | the pixel framebuffer, terrain generation, carve / deposit / settle |
| `physics.ts` | the projectile integrator (gravity, wind, viscosity, speed clamp) |
| `weapons.ts`, `weapon_behaviors.ts` | the 48-item table; rollers, diggers, MIRV, laser, riot |
| `damage.ts`, `death.ts`, `hazard.ts` | radial damage, shields, fall damage, death throes, sky hazards |
| `ai.ts`, `guidance.ts` | the seven computer types and the aiming oracle |
| `economy.ts`, `scoring.ts` | the free-market shop, interest, scoring and rankings |
| `game.ts` | the round / turn loop, fire / impact pipeline, win test |
| `pygame.ts` | a faithful pygame API over Canvas2D (Surface, draw, surfarray, font) |
| `render.ts`, `ui.ts`, `widgets.ts`, `screens.ts`, `ingame.ts` | rendering, HUD, menus, shop, dialogs |
| `sprites.ts`, `palette.ts`, `sound.ts` | the recovered art + `.MTN` decoder, color tables, Web Audio |
| `mtn.ts` | the `.MTN` terrain-photo decoder |
| `main.ts` | the requestAnimationFrame loop, input, state machine, asset boot, IndexedDB saves |

`oracle/` holds the Python vector dumpers; `test/` the differential suite; `visual/`
the rendering gate.
